## Customization

### Change the Launch Date

To change the launch date, update the following line in the `index.html` file:

```html
var countDownDate = new Date("Aug 3, 2024 00:00:00").getTime();
```

Replace `"Aug 3, 2024 00:00:00"` with your desired launch date and time.

### Modify Styles

To modify the styles, edit the `style.css` file. You can change colors, fonts, layout, and more to fit your design preferences.

### Update Images

Replace `logo.png` and `rocket.png` in the `images` directory with your own images. Ensure the new images have the same file names, or update the `src` attributes in the `index.html` file accordingly.
